# Description

### What is this?

This is a repository of a project to investigate the influence of the selection of kernels
for Gaussian processes on the process of modeling light curves of different objects from
the Kepler Archive. For more information on the research, see the
[online documentation](https://paveloom-c.github.io/GPKernels).

### Wait, why isn't this branch called `master`/`main`?

This repository consists of four main branches:
* [`notebooks`](https://github.com/paveloom-c/GPKernels/): contains Jupyter notebooks and
Julia scripts to convert these notebooks to Markdown files;
* [`docker`](https://github.com/paveloom-c/GPKernels/tree/docker): provides a Docker image
that contains the development environment for this project;
* [`okteto`](https://github.com/paveloom-c/GPKernels/tree/okteto): provides a configuration
YAML file for Kubernetes;
* [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/paveloom-c/GPKernels/tree/gh-pages): contains the
automatically converted documentation files.

### What do these releases mean?

Releases involve changes on the [`notebooks`](https://github.com/paveloom-c/GPKernels/)
branch, that is, the research process.
