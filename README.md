# Description

This branch is designed to maintain the configuration YAML file for
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home). The orchestra consists of the Docker container
([`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/paveloom-c/GPKernels/blob/docker/Dockerfile) on the
[`docker`](https://github.com/paveloom-c/GPKernels/tree/docker) branch) containing the
development environment and a service to provide access to a Jupyter Lab instance. The
branch name is associated with the [Okteto](https://okteto.com) service, which allows
you to run all this magic in the cloud with a single click.
